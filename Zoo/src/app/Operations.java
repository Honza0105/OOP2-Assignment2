		// Initialize an AnimalFactory using an anonymous inner class and get animals from it
		// Then add the animals to the Zoo
		
		// Have several caretakers feed some animals. Use lambda expressions in that
		// Loop over all animals to pass time and see that their Caretakers get informed about
		// their pets getting hungry
		
		// Implement a plugin for acquiring new animals. The strategy used for that is to clone an existing animal.
		// Cloning has a fixed price defined in the plugin code itself
		// Run the test with the plugin as well
